************ Flex in css ****************

***Flex Direction***

The flex-direction property defines the direction in which the flex items are placed in the flex container.

1.row (default): Items are placed in a row, from left to right.
2.row-reverse: Items are placed in a row, but in reverse order, from right to left.
3.column: Items are placed in a column, from top to bottom.
4.column-reverse: Items are placed in a column, but in reverse order, from bottom to top.

*** Justify Content ***
The justify-content property aligns the flex items along the main axis (horizontal in a row, vertical in a column).

flex-start (default): Items are aligned at the start.
flex-end: Items are aligned at the end.
center: Items are centered.
space-between: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space between them.


***Align Items***
The align-items property aligns the flex items along the cross axis (vertical in a row, horizontal in a column).

stretch (default): Items stretch to fill the container (if no height is set).
flex-start: Items are aligned at the start.
flex-end: Items are aligned at the end.
center: Items are centered.
baseline: Items are aligned along their baseline.


***Flex Wrap***
The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not if there isn't enough space.

nowrap (default): All flex items will be in one line.
wrap: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
wrap-reverse: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, but from bottom to top.

***Align Content***

The align-content property aligns a flex container's lines within the container when there is extra space on the cross-axis. It works only when there are multiple lines of flex items.

flex-start: Lines are packed at the start.
flex-end: Lines are packed at the end.
center: Lines are packed in the center.
space-between: Lines are evenly distributed with the first line at the start and the last line at the end.
space-around: Lines are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
stretch (default): Lines stretch to take up the remaining space.

***Order***

The order property specifies the order of the flex items. The default value is 0, and items with a lower order value appear first.

***Flex Grow, Shrink, and Basis***

Flex-grow: Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the items inside the container.

Flex-shrink: Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the items inside the container.

Flex-basis: Specifies the initial size of the flex item before space distribution. Can be set to a fixed size (e.g., 100px) or auto.


The flex property is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
